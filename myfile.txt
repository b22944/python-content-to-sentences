Buin you hear hey girlies so today's video is going to be I don't even know if this is considered a story time or if this is just like a chat video but this is something that I mentioned on Twitter and snapchat a couple of months ago and a lot of people keep bringing it back up and ilig nesting you never made a story time you never really explained to us what you were even talking about so today I'm going to be talking about satanic instagramers when I lived in my old apartment complex I'm not going to expose the address I'm not going to expose the building because people might still live there at my old apartment complex I I don't even know where to start this story let's just say I move there and I moved at the Lexia but she ended up moving out so I was like boom I need to make some new friends around the building so then a couple months later I started mingling with all the little social media people that I always sell filming vines I always saw them just walking around and they were out from these so I said hello so I became pretty close friends with a lot of his people I mean we were shooting stuff we were aiming at we were getting dinner we were getting lunch we were just all chillin and at this apartment complex there was a campfire bo station kind of thing where we can go and everyone just sits around and talks so I remember one day we were sitting there and somebody brought up saying hey have any of you guys ever done any like scary stuff and I was like what does what does that even mean like are you referencing my ghost stories or are you like actually asking so this girl Chris needs to tell me that on the sixth floor on sixth floor they're doing CJ this sounds so stupid this girl told me that on the sixth floor they were doing satanic worshiping and they were doing rituals for oliver's and success and I know that sounds like a load of [ __ ] but I'm dead-ass you guys like if I need to bring this girl in as a source for people to not think I'm bullshitting I will bring her in as a source so this girl is over here telling the entire campfire that there's satanic worshiping going on on the 6th floor so if you're trying to get successful if you're trying to get some more followers go up there and they'll help you now this intrigued me because you know you always hear the stories about Hollywood and early people always selling their souls to the devil for success and music careers and stuff but I'm gonna okay I don't understand it because I would never sell my [ __ ] soul if I have one in the first place but literally why would you sell your soul for a successful Instagram video career I mean I'm not backing anybody who does that because I enjoy going on Instagram and watching those videos they make me laugh my ass off so I'm not backing night at all I make youtube videos that's not any better I'm just saying why would you go against God crystal for a couple followers so it just really made me laugh because you know I see these celebrities supposedly conspiracy theory Illuminati all this stuff that they sell their souls to get millions of dollars and all this stuff so yeah they're getting their Millions cool do you burn in hell at the end of the day your business at least you had fun like I feel like that's just really desperate but I listened to what she said and I was really thinking about and I was like okay I'm going to investigate y'all know I am a nosy ass [ __ ] I'm always sticking my nose well not anymore now I'd mind my own business but old Vanessa last year 2016 I wasn't asked it was a very very sick time in my life we all know that you've all seen the videos but my messy-ass was gonna investigate and get more information because like I said I'm nosy so one day I go on the 6th floor like I said be nosy and I'm just hanging out with my friends somebody had an apartment on the sixth floor so I was just like there's children some boy walks by and the girl who told me all the information about the saint and a person was like that's the one he runs so I recognize this boy before I remember seeing him on the explore page on Instagram and I think I also saw him in a Instagram comedians little videos videos where they'll open up the door and they'll accidentally get smacked by it or something somehow so I remember seeing this boy and a lot of that person's videos and stuff now this is gonna make me sound a little bit crazy but if you watch my paranormal videos if you watch any of my ghost stuff you guys know that I have like I don't know if it's going to sixth sense or something like I just can feel when there's a bad aura around like a feel when it's a really bad situation I don't think I'm a psychic but I feel like I can send someone like things are about to just like take a batter but when this guy walked by I swear on my entire life that I felt something before he even hit the corner I got the chills yes that apartment complex was cold half the time I'm not surprised when evil things are lurking it gets cold all my friends that would come over too I think oh my gosh why are these holes freezing so I would go up to the leasing office and complain to me we literally tried to warm it up but it won't get warm it's so cold here hmm but dead-ass I felt like some sort of like cold like eerie presence as he walked past me before she even opened her mouth I said that's it that's it so when I get back home later on I go on Instagram and I go through this person comedian person's Instagram and I'm trying to look for this boy because I hadn't seen her or seen him and one of her videos in a while but I remember seeing him so I'm just scrolling scrolling eventually I find his that and I go to his profile and I'm kind of just looking through it being nosey I don't know if you guys have ever noticed this but whenever okay so when I was in psychology in high school we did a project on serial killers and murders and all this stuff and if you look in their eyes they all have a similar look it's just like darkness hollow so little eyes like you just don't see anything in there it's just empty eyes and whenever I looked at all of these are all of this boy's photos that's all I saw in all of his pics all I saw was a soulless empty things like yeah he might have been smiling but I didn't see any sort of light in his eye I didn't see any eyes he had to I didn't see any sort of like yeah he was smiling but he didn't look joyful I looked kind of creepy so immediately I walked in my phone cuz I now when I first moved to LA with Alexia there was no problems in the apartment it felt very clear yes there were a few like incidences that happened but that follows me everywhere I go so it's nothing new to me it's nothing different but after Alexia left a couple months later whatever all that that's when the apartment started to feel kind of you know eerie I'm day when I was this was around the time this [ __ ] boy but one day me and him were just hanging out in my apartment and then a bunch of guys came to my apartment one day like I didn't know any of them they were just a bunch of Instagram boys for his friends cuz that's what this boy was trying to do at the time or whatever I didn't know any of them personally of course I've seen their faces before but I didn't know them personally because I just seen them on like the Explorer piece once again with that same comedian the person and after they all left my house that day I just felt like something wasn't the same I asked the boy that I was with at the time who his friends were what their names were and all this stuff and I started investigating once again like the nosy [ __ ] I am and I find out that they're actually friends with that boy now I'm not saying because they're friends with him they're going to do everything that he does whatever but when you are friends with somebody and they were in almost every single post with him you're probably no knowledgeable of what they're doing I mean the entire building knows so obviously they know what he's doing so I don't know if they took part of it or whatever but after they left my apartment that day it didn't feel the same I felt very eerie my friend actually one time came over and she's like Vanessa like I don't know if you feel that I mean I'm pretty sensitive to this kind of stuff but it doesn't feel good in here my friend actually believes and all that spiritual stuff she believes in all of the Mojo's and the auras and all that stuff just like me and she said one day she just came into my apartment and it just didn't feel the same I felt very dark it's very heavy it felt very unsafe you asked me if there was any Ouija board playing going on in the house if there was any midnight game bath game all these things whatever going on and I said no room I don't do any of that stuff I already deal with my own [ __ ] I'm not trying to start any more and she asked me if anybody knew had come into my apartment or if anyone that I didn't know personally just like came around to me and I said yeah these people came into my apartment cuz it was his friend she's like mmm now I'm not saying that they brought in yes I am I'm saying that they brought something in my house I honestly believe that they brought some sort of negative presence hey penny I really think they brought some sort of negative presence into my home that day after that no matter how many times I got the place cleaned no matter how many times I got the carpet refreshed and windows left open what are those things incense chakra that's Naruto so I'm doing all these little things to clear the space like everything seemed very fresh and no matter what I did I couldn't get it now around this time is when everything was falling apart in my life you guys my relationship I had was literally going down south the friendships that I had was becoming very toxic I was doing things that I'd never done in the first place my home felt unsafe I did feel asleep sleeping in my own bed which nobody to share that I feel that I lost all complete motivation to my youtube channel I lost all complete motivation with everything that I was doing in my life I didn't want to do anything I didn't care my depression was that an all-time high my anxiety was an all-time high literally all of it just hit me at once my mom didn't even understand everything just suddenly started to go wrong and I'm not trying to say like oh because they brought something and that's what it was but if you put yourself in a negative situation a negative environment that can happen now of course I made poor decisions around that time I made bad decisions but even when things started to get better it would also crumble even more like I don't know what I'm not talking about like oh it was just uh this situation happens so this was the conclusion no it just would be okay and then BOOM not okay now I went back to this girl to ask her more information and more questions about this satanic guy because I really believe that if you have a negative force on the outside it can actually improve in your life you guys it could actually make things go wrong so I was talking to her about I was like whenever you like came across this person get anything negative really happen in your life did anything like really change and she said yeah actually I talked to the guy one time and literally a couple days later I was evicted from my home and I said you're lying she got it she said this boy would keep trying to talk to her he would try to keep flirting with her because she was just a cute girl so you tried to flirt with her not stuff it every time she would turn him down something wrong would happen in her life and at that point you and me and her we're friends the reason she was in that apartment complex is because she was sleeping on somebody's couch in that apartment welcome back it's she told me that ever since she blocked the guy on every single thing and every time she sees him she goes the other way her life husband making a turn for the better now I'm not sure if he's the only one that's doing it I'm pretty sure it's a lot of other people I have a lot of tea on a lot of Instagram comedians but we're not gonna spill all of that right down it's not my place now like I said I'm not sure if he's the only one that does this stuff but I'm pretty sure there's other people be I mean this boy that I'm talking about has quite a few followers he dies he doesn't have 20k he doesn't have 100k he has many caves many followers I asked the girl who knew him personally and I said has he always had all these followers has he always been doing the Satanic star but she said no he started supposed to be doing all this stuff when he moved to the apartment complex and that's when he started to actually grow so I don't know you guys that's a conspiracy theory this is a conspiracy theory video very spirited for me nice family I saw it every time I film something there is a police car going by do I need to move to a better neighborhood so this video like I said is literally just a conspiracy theory it's not a story time it's just what I've experienced while I was living in that building then I moved out of there you guys you don't understand the weight that I felt come off of me when I got into this new apartment I felt such a breath of fresh air I felt like I could breathe in here for months I wish I could have brought all of you into my old place just to feel it like you would walk in with an amazing mood like say you just made a million dollars this movie but say you made a million dollars and you're walking you're but I guess it doesn't really matter I mean yeah it's just money but it won't make you happy but we'll literally go from being the most happiest joyful person to just being depressed a lot of my friends would not want to go to my apartment because they felt that when they would walk in and I don't blame them that's why I wanted to get out of my lease so fast okay my lease let's say it ended when did it end March February my lease ended around March 13th and I've been trying to get out of that least since December January time so the rules to get out of the lease were basically you have to pay the next three months of your rent even if you have nine months left you only have to pay three months and then you're out of it which is so stupid because got so much money in the contract it said say you have only two months left so you only have to pay those two months but every time I would try to get out of my lease even if I only had two months left or one month left they would keep saying oh you have to pay ten thousand dollars oh wait no actually have to pay fifteen numbers coming from they wouldn't let me leave I don't know something was attaching me to that place are not allowing me to go but every time I tried to go up in that office and get the [ __ ] out the prices kept going up and it was like I was stuck so I was so relieved to get out of there I mean yeah stuff does happen in this apartment once in a while but it feels Airy it feels like I can breathe I don't feel like I'm walking into doomsday or 2012 the movie so yeah that's just a little experience I wanted to share with you guys because so many of you guys have been asking me what were you talking about me it's been one minute oh yeah like I was saying this is just like it's like a conspiracy theory I mean I'm not sure if there were these seeds in this or whatever but if everyone in the building is mentioning it like people that I met that first day they're like did you hear about the Satanists on the sixth floor did you hear about the worshipping on the seventh what if instagramers are doing this are youtubers doing it are you now is doing it selling my soul for ten thousand bars like I said when I moved out of this apart or that apartment complex Wow my life turned
